/**
 * Mute matrix — local mute vs moderator (server) mute.
 *
 * Two distinct mute paths the app builds on LiveKit, both asserted by real audio
 * flow through real LiveKit (no human listener):
 *   - LOCAL mute:     a user mutes their OWN mic → peers stop receiving them.
 *   - MODERATOR mute: an admin mutes ANOTHER participant via the backend
 *                     (POST /livekit/channels/:id/mute-participant →
 *                      RoomServiceClient.mutePublishedTrack) → peers stop
 *                     receiving the muted user.
 *
 * "Stops receiving" is asserted as inbound audio bytes no longer growing
 * (totalAudioEnergy is cumulative and can't decrease, so we assert no-growth).
 *
 * Requires the real-LiveKit stack: scripts/run-voice-e2e.sh

/**
 * Mute negative / permission cases (Piece B) — the things that must NOT happen,
 * and rapid state changes that must not desync, over real LiveKit.
 *
 *   1. MODERATOR-MUTE IS DENIED for a non-privileged member. An ordinary member
 *      (InstanceRole.USER, no community mute role) calling the mute endpoint must
 *      be rejected (403). A positive control proves the same endpoint succeeds
 *      for an OWNER — so the 403 is authorization, not a broken endpoint.
 *   2. RAPID LOCAL MUTE/UNMUTE TOGGLES don't desync: the final state wins — a
 *      burst ending "unmuted" → peer receives; ending "muted" → peer stops.
 *
 * The member never joins voice (a USER-role account isn't driven through the
 * voice-join UI here); it calls the mute REST endpoint directly via
 * `tryModeratorMuteAs`. The mute *target* is a real voice participant so the
 * 403/positive-control assertions act on an actual live publication.
 *
 * Requires the real-LiveKit stack: scripts/run-voice-e2e.sh

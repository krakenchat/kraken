/**
 * PR #351 validation — live audio device switching (#346).
 *
 * The fix wires Settings → Voice & Video's mic <Select> through
 * `onDeviceChange` → `switchAudioInputDevice` → `room.switchActiveDevice(
 * 'audioinput', deviceId)`, so changing the input device swaps the ACTIVE
 * LiveKit capture track live, with NO rejoin.
 *
 * This spec asserts that LiveKit behaviour directly against a real server via the
 * `__lkSwitchMic` hook (which calls the exact same `room.switchActiveDevice` the
 * UI path ends in). It deliberately does NOT drive the Settings DOM:
 *   - the form wiring (onDeviceChange → switchAudioInputDevice) is covered by
 *     unit tests `VoiceSettings.test.tsx` / `AudioVideoSettingsPanel.test.tsx`;
 *   - the lazy `/settings` route does not render reliably under this headless
 *     e2e harness, and the *valuable* part an E2E adds over the unit test is
 *     proving the live track actually swaps against real LiveKit without
 *     dropping the connection — which is exactly what this does.
 *
 * #347 (input-sensitivity threshold persistence) is a pure client-side
 * localStorage behaviour with no LiveKit interaction; it is fully covered by the
 * `AudioVideoSettingsPanel.test.tsx` unit test and is intentionally not
 * duplicated here.
 *
 * Requires the real-LiveKit stack: scripts/run-voice-e2e.sh

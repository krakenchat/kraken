# BUGS

Refreshing doesn't drop you from the voice presence list, you have to click again to join the chat but you are displayed to others as in.

Audio settings aren't persisting, users can change their input and it gets ignored on refresh

Random permission block for DMs -- user couldn't start a dm (didn't validate this)

Screen shares are black until I click on them to fullscreen and then click away -- this could have been just weird timing

Replay icon is a download icon which sucks

Custom trim click to seek isn't working all the time, some times it does nothing

Refreshing and rejoining the server doesn't show other users in the channel presence list, presence is just super buggy right now.

Should be able to search for emojis

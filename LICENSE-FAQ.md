# Kraken Chat — License FAQ

Q: Can I use Kraken Chat for free?
A: YES! Anyone may use Kraken Chat under the AGPLv3 license, including for commercial purposes, as long as you comply with the AGPL's terms (primarily: share your source code if you modify and deploy it).

Q: I'm a student, educator, or non-profit. Do I need a commercial license?
A: NO. Use under AGPLv3 is free for everyone, including academic and non-profit organizations.

Q: I want to host Kraken Chat for myself, my friends, or my community. Do I need a commercial license?
A: NO. Personal, hobby, and self-hosted instances — including those you run for free for your own community or friends — do NOT require a commercial license. Just follow the AGPLv3 terms.

Q: I want to host Kraken Chat as a free public service — do I need a commercial license?
A: NO. Hosting Kraken Chat as a free, open, non-profit community service is allowed under the AGPLv3.

Q: I want to modify or contribute to Kraken Chat. Do I need a commercial license?
A: Contributions and modifications are always welcome under the AGPLv3. As long as you release your modified source code per the AGPL's terms, no commercial license is needed.

Q: I want to run Kraken Chat in my startup, business, or SaaS offering. Do I need a commercial license?
A: Not necessarily. Businesses CAN use Kraken Chat under the AGPLv3 — but AGPL requires that you make the complete source code of your deployment (including any modifications) available to your users. If you don't want that obligation, you need a commercial license.

Q: I want to offer Kraken Chat as a paid hosted service. What are my obligations?
A: You have two options: (1) comply with the AGPLv3 by making your full service source code available, OR (2) purchase a commercial license to keep your source proprietary.

Q: I want to integrate Kraken Chat into a closed-source or proprietary product.
A: The AGPLv3 does not allow this — you would need to open-source the combined work. If you want to keep your product closed-source, you MUST purchase a commercial license.

Q: I'm still unsure?
A: Email licensing {at} krakenchat [dot] app for clarification!

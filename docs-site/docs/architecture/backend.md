# Backend Architecture

The backend is a **NestJS** application in `backend/src/` using modular architecture with Prisma ORM, Socket.IO, and LiveKit integration.

## Module Organization

### Core Infrastructure

| Module | Purpose |
|--------|---------|
| `auth/` | JWT authentication, Passport strategies, RBAC guards |
| `database/` | Prisma service and connection management |
| `redis/` | Redis connection, pub/sub |
| `cache/` | Redis caching service |
| `roles/` | Role definitions and permission checking |
| `health/` | Health check endpoints |

### User & Social

| Module | Purpose |
|--------|---------|
| `user/` | User CRUD, profiles, avatars, banners |
| `friends/` | Friend requests, accept/decline/block |
| `presence/` | Online status tracking (multi-connection aware) |
| `appearance-settings/` | Theme preferences (accent color, intensity) |

### Community & Channels

| Module | Purpose |
|--------|---------|
| `community/` | Community CRUD, settings, invites |
| `channels/` | Text/voice channel management, reordering |
| `membership/` | Community membership (join/leave) |
| `channel-membership/` | Private channel access control |
| `invite/` | Instance and community invitation system |
| `onboarding/` | First-time instance setup wizard |
| `alias-groups/` | Mention groups within communities |

### Messaging

| Module | Purpose |
|--------|---------|
| `messages/` | Message CRUD with spans, attachments, reactions |
| `threads/` | Thread replies, subscription, notifications |
| `direct-messages/` | 1:1 and group DM management |
| `notifications/` | Notification creation and delivery |
| `read-receipts/` | Message read tracking |

### Voice & Media

| Module | Purpose |
|--------|---------|
| `livekit/` | Token generation, room management, replay buffer |
| `rooms/` | Room state for voice/video sessions |
| `file/` | Authenticated file serving with range support |
| `file-upload/` | File upload handling |
| `storage/` | Storage abstraction layer |
| `storage-quota/` | Per-user storage quota enforcement |

### Moderation

| Module | Purpose |
|--------|---------|
| `moderation/` | Ban, kick, timeout, moderation logs |
| `instance/` | Instance-level settings and admin panel |

## Request Flow

```
HTTP Request
    |
Controller (route + decorators)
    |-- @RequiredActions(RbacActions.CREATE_MESSAGE)
    |-- @RbacResource({ type: CHANNEL, idKey: 'channelId', source: PAYLOAD })
    |
Guards (JwtAuthGuard -> RbacGuard)
    |
Service (business logic)
    |
Prisma (database operations)
    |
EventEmitter2 (domain events) --> RoomSubscriptionHandler --> WebsocketService
```

### Authentication Flow

1. **Login**: `POST /auth/login` -> validates credentials -> returns JWT access + refresh tokens
2. **Access**: Every request includes `Authorization: Bearer <token>` -> `JwtAuthGuard` validates
3. **Refresh**: `POST /auth/refresh` -> validates refresh token -> issues new pair
4. **RBAC**: `RbacGuard` checks user's roles against `@RequiredActions()` decorator

### RBAC Pattern

```typescript
@RequiredActions(RbacActions.CREATE_MESSAGE)
@RbacResource({
  type: RbacResourceType.CHANNEL,
  idKey: 'channelId',
  source: ResourceIdSource.PAYLOAD,
})
@Post()
async createMessage(@Body() dto: CreateMessageDto) { ... }
```

The guard resolves the resource (channel -> community), loads the user's roles for that community, and checks if any role includes the required action.

## WebSocket Architecture

### Gateways

- **MessagesGateway** -- `SEND_MESSAGE`, `EDIT_MESSAGE`, `DELETE_MESSAGE`, reactions, typing
- **PresenceGateway** -- User connect/disconnect, online status

Both gateways use `JwtWsGuard` for authentication.

### WebsocketService

Central service for broadcasting events to rooms:

```typescript
this.websocketService.sendToRoom(
  RoomName.community(communityId),
  ServerEvents.CHANNEL_CREATED,
  payload,
);
```

### Redis Adapter

In multi-pod deployments, `RedisIoAdapter` ensures Socket.IO events reach all connected clients regardless of which pod they're connected to.

### Event Emission

Two patterns coexist:

1. **EventEmitter2** -- Services emit domain events; `RoomSubscriptionHandler` translates to WebSocket broadcasts. Used when the service doesn't have `WebsocketService` injected.
2. **Direct** -- Gateways and hybrid services call `websocketService.sendToRoom()` directly.

See [WebSocket Patterns](websocket-patterns.md) for the full guide.

## Key Patterns

### Sensitive User Fields

Never return raw Prisma `User` objects. Always wrap in `new UserEntity(user)` which applies `@Exclude()` decorators. Use `PUBLIC_USER_SELECT` constant for database queries to avoid fetching sensitive fields.

### OpenAPI/Swagger

- Add `@ApiProperty({ enum: XxxValues })` for Prisma enums (NestJS Swagger plugin can't introspect them)
- Import `PartialType` from `@nestjs/swagger`, **not** `@nestjs/mapped-types`
- Add `@ApiOkResponse({ type: FooDto })` to controllers for typed responses

### File Serving

Files are served through authenticated endpoints with range request support for video streaming. The `FileService` validates access permissions before serving.

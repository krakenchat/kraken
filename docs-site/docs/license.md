# License

Kraken is **dual-licensed** under the AGPLv3 and a commercial license.

## AGPLv3 (default)

The [GNU Affero General Public License v3](https://www.gnu.org/licenses/agpl-3.0.html) is the default license. It's free for everyone — including commercial use — as long as you comply with its terms. The primary requirement: if you modify and deploy Kraken, you must share your source code.

## Commercial license

A commercial license is available for those who want to keep modifications proprietary or avoid AGPL source-sharing obligations. Contact **licensing {at} krakenchat [dot] app** for details.

## Frequently asked questions

**Can I use Kraken for free?**
:   Yes. Anyone may use Kraken under the AGPLv3, including for commercial purposes, as long as you comply with the AGPL terms (share your source code if you modify and deploy it).

**I'm a student, educator, or non-profit. Do I need a commercial license?**
:   No. Use under AGPLv3 is free for everyone, including academic and non-profit organizations.

**I want to self-host Kraken for myself, my friends, or my community. Do I need a commercial license?**
:   No. Personal, hobby, and self-hosted instances — including those you run for free for your own community — do not require a commercial license. Just follow the AGPLv3 terms.

**I want to host Kraken as a free public service. Do I need a commercial license?**
:   No. Hosting Kraken as a free, open, non-profit community service is allowed under the AGPLv3.

**I want to modify or contribute to Kraken. Do I need a commercial license?**
:   Contributions and modifications are welcome under the AGPLv3. As long as you release your modified source code per the AGPL terms, no commercial license is needed.

**I want to run Kraken in my startup or SaaS offering. Do I need a commercial license?**
:   Not necessarily. Businesses can use Kraken under the AGPLv3 — but AGPL requires that you make the complete source code of your deployment (including modifications) available to your users. If you don't want that obligation, you need a commercial license.

**I want to offer Kraken as a paid hosted service. What are my obligations?**
:   You have two options: (1) comply with the AGPLv3 by making your full service source code available, or (2) purchase a commercial license to keep your source proprietary.

**I want to integrate Kraken into a closed-source or proprietary product.**
:   The AGPLv3 does not allow this — you would need to open-source the combined work. If you want to keep your product closed-source, you must purchase a commercial license.

**I'm still unsure.**
:   Email **licensing {at} krakenchat [dot] app** for clarification.
